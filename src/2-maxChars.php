Though process :

Seem somewhat easier at first glance than the first, as there are less ways for it to go wrong.

I can see two solution to the problem : eitheir the "brute force" method, or the "hashmap" method
I don't think PHP really has hashmaps, rather it has associative arrays, but we could use a similar logic

Then there is also another issue : if we have multiple characters in a tie, should we return the first character that reaches the max number, or the first character that appears and happens to reach the max number ?
ex : abbbaa -> both "a" and "b" have 3 occurences, but should we return "b" because it's the first to reach the max number, or "a" because it's the first "in order" ?

Maybe the 2nd would be easier with an "hashmap" method ?

Actually, by improving the code and tracking the biggest occurence in a single loop, it's easier to track the one that reaches the threeshold first

But we can still achieve the other outcome by having a second loop. Let's make an alt solution
